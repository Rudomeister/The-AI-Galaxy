# ðŸŒŒ AI-Galaxy â€“ A Self-Expanding, Agent-Driven Microservice Civilization

AI-Galaxy is a structured and self-organizing AI system built on semantic search, agents, and a hierarchical data structure. It combines a high degree of automation with strict structure, and is designed to let ideas evolve into microservices through collaboration between meta-layers and domain-specific entities.

## ðŸ§  Structure

**HIGHER-META-LAYER**
- Decides which departments should exist
- Steps in when semantic search is lacking and initiates new ideas

**LOWER-META-LAYER**
- `council_agent.py`: Evaluates idea proposals and decides what moves forward
- `creator_agent.py`: Creates templates from approved ideas
- `implementer_agent.py`: Responsible for the progress of idea realization
- `programmer_agent.py`: Writes the actual code
- `router_agent.py`: Routes the idea to the correct department or institution
- `registrar_agent.py`: Registers and archives completed microservices

**DEPARTMENTS**
- Main areas, e.g. machine learning, NLP, image processing
- Can be `active` (building services) or `inactive` (owning code resources)

**INSTITUTIONS**
- Narrower sectors under departments, e.g. Keras, Vision Transformers
- Create microservices specifically within their field

**MICROSERVICES**
- Finished functions/services generated by institutions

**SERVICES**
- Redis for sharing and state
- Vector Search for semantic search of resources
- Meta Planner for discovering structural gaps

## ðŸ§© Flow

1. An idea is created in `idea_factory`
2. It goes through `validator â†’ council`
3. Approved ideas are handled by `creator â†’ implementer â†’ programmer`
4. The idea is routed to the correct department/institution
5. If the resource does not exist â†’ triggers `meta_planner` â†’ new department is created
