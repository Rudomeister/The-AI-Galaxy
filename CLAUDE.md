- Each has a `manifest.yaml` with metadata

**INSTITUTIONS** (institutions/)
- Specialized sectors under departments (e.g., Keras, Vision Transformers)
- Create microservices within their specific domain
- Contains `/services/` subdirectory for generated microservices

**MICROSERVICES** (microservices/)
- Final output: independent, functional services generated by institutions

## 🏗️ **Enhanced Core Services**

**🔄 Redis Pub/Sub Infrastructure** (services/redis/db.py)
- **REVOLUTIONARY:** Now powers autonomous agent communication
- Real-time message processing and task distribution
- Agent coordination and workflow orchestration
- Shared state management and data persistence
- **<1ms latency** for operational data

**🔍 Vector Search Engine** (services/vector_search/query_service.py)  
- Semantic search engine for intelligent resource discovery
- ChromaDB integration for vector embeddings
- Content similarity analysis and knowledge discovery
- Enables meaning-based decisions and smart routing

**🧠 Meta Planner & Evolution System** (services/meta_planner/)
- Detects structural gaps and suggests new departments
- **NEW:** Enhanced Evolution Agent provides adaptive intelligence
- Ecosystem health monitoring and optimization
- Predictive analysis and bottleneck prevention
- Auto-optimization and performance enhancement

## Idea Processing Flow

**🚀 ENHANCED Automatic Workflow Integration:**
1. Ideas created via API are automatically stored in Redis + indexed in ChromaDB
2. **ENHANCED:** Ideas instantly published to Redis pub/sub system
3. **AUTONOMOUS:** Enhanced agents automatically subscribe and process tasks
4. **PARALLEL:** Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
5. **REAL-TIME:** SystemOrchestrator monitors and coordinates via message bus
6. **INTELLIGENT:** Ideas progress through optimized state machine with adaptive routing
7. **EVOLUTIONARY:** System learns and improves workflow efficiency over time

**Enhanced States:** created → validated → council_review → approved → template_created → implementation_started → coding_in_progress → completed → **registered → evolved**

**Manual Processing:**
1. Ideas created in `idea_factory`
2. Validation through `validator → council`
3. Approved ideas processed by `creator → implementer → programmer`
4. Router directs to appropriate department/institution
5. Missing resources trigger `meta_planner` → new department creation

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ideas stuck in "created" status indicate workflow integration issues
- Use `idea_discovery_task.py` to identify and process stuck ideas
- Check persistent Docker volumes if ideas aren't entering workflow

## State Machine

The system uses `config/state_machine.yaml` to define idea processing flows, with routing logic in `core/state_machine/router.py`.

## Project Structure & Patterns

**🤖 ENHANCED Agent Pattern:**
- **REVOLUTIONARY:** All agents inherit from BaseAgentHandler for autonomous operation
- **REAL-TIME:** Agents communicate autonomously via Redis pub/sub messaging
- **STATEFUL:** Enhanced agents maintain processing metrics and task tracking
- **INTELLIGENT:** Each agent has 7-14 specialized capabilities with 8-24 task types
- **AUTONOMOUS:** Agents subscribe to task channels and process independently
- **MONITORED:** Complete visibility with status reporting and heartbeat monitoring
- **ADAPTIVE:** Agents use structured logging and performance optimization

**Service Pattern:**
- Services are created via factory functions (create_redis_service, create_vector_search_service)
- Configuration objects (RedisConfig, SearchConfig) define service settings
- Services provide async interfaces for all operations

**API Pattern:**
- Router-based organization with dependency injection
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication
- Health checks and metrics endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

**State Management:**
- Ideas flow through well-defined states in state machine
- Redis maintains shared state across all components
- State transitions are validated and logged
- Error handling with retry policies and fallback states

## System Configuration

**Main Config:** `config.yaml` contains:
- Redis connection settings (localhost:6379)
- Vector search configuration (ChromaDB)
- System orchestrator settings
- API server configuration (port 8080)
- Logging and monitoring settings

**State Machine:** `ai_galaxy/config/state_machine.yaml` defines:
- Idea processing workflow states (created → validated → council_review → approved → template_created → implementation_started → coding_in_progress → completed → archived)
- Agent assignments for each transition (validator_agent, council_agent, creator_agent, implementer_agent, programmer_agent, registrar_agent)
- Retry policies and error handling with timeouts
- Routing rules and monitoring metrics
- Comprehensive transition conditions and actions

## Key Services

**System Orchestrator:** (`orchestrator.py`)
- Central coordination hub for all agents and services
- Manages agent lifecycle and task distribution
- Provides system metrics and health monitoring

**Dual Database Architecture:**
- **Redis:** Real-time operations, agent coordination, workflow state management, pub/sub messaging, session tracking, distributed locks. Provides <1ms performance for operational data.
- **ChromaDB:** Semantic search, vector embeddings, intelligent routing, content similarity, knowledge discovery. Enables meaning-based decisions and smart idea-to-department routing.

**Why Both Are Needed:**
- Redis handles immediate consistency and real-time coordination
- ChromaDB provides semantic understanding and intelligent discovery
- Different data access patterns: operational (Redis) vs analytical (ChromaDB)
- Separation of concerns: "nervous system" vs "brain" functionality
